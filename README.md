# Data_Structures_Project

## Description
This project was a final project within a data structures class at the University of Colorado Boulder.
The aim of this project was to create multiple different data structures:
* Linked list
* Binary search tree
* Hash table

We then test the efficiency of both insertion and searching of data against two CSV files, containing 40000 data entries each. Finally, we then use the timings we generate to plot graphs in order to evaluate the efficiency of each data type. A final report based on our finding was then written and submitted along with the code found here.

## Dependencies
Programs within this project are written in the following languages:
|Language|Versions      |
|:------:|:------------:|
|C++     |11 and above  |
|Python  |3.7 and above |

#### Python dependencies:
Python requires two libraries that are not included with the default distribution:
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html "Pandas' Webpage")
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org "Matplotlib's Webpage")

## Usage
In order to generate graphs for all data structures simultaneously just run the executor.py file.
This can be done using the following command in the terminal when Data_Structures_Project directory:
```bash
$ python executor.py
```
You will then find all graph generated in the Graphs directory

## How to install dependencies:
### Matplotlib:
Using Andaconda or Miniconda:
```bash
$ conda install matplotlib
```
Using pip:
```bash
$ pip install matplotlib
```

### Pandas:
Using Andaconda or Miniconda:
```bash
$ conda install pandas
```
Using pip:
```bash
$ pip install pandas
```
